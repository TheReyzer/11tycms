 hen we are reading some article on web, more about code, the colors of the words are real important to understand what the code make.

Ex:

```javascript
if(tired == 'true'){
  console.log('Drink some coffee!');
}
```

You can see the difference when the condition start and when finish. Thanks for plugins like [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) that I'm using here.  Now is time to keep studying pagination, the site need thahhat.
