 When we are reading some articles on the web, more about code, the colors of the words are really important to understand what the code does.

Ex:

```javascript
if(tired == 'true'){
  console.log('Drink some coffee!');
}
```

You can see the difference between when the condition starts and when finishes. Thanks for plugins like [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) that I'm using here.  Now is the time to keep studying pagination, the site needs that.
