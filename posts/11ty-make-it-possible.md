A big thanks to all community from 11ty on Discord. I find lovely people in there and I was so happy... yesterday @chriskirknielson help me on Discord to fix the pagination "problem", if you can see, when you go paginate the site, we have `/posts/` and `/posts/2/` and not `/posts/1/`; For computers that's not an error here, but for humans... it's maybe strange to go from the index page to 1 page...

Now, I will keep learning and putting here like a diary as well to register my progress. Use [11ty!](https://www.11ty.dev)
