This "blog" was created not just to registry progress like a diary, but, to learn 11ty, especially to create a new version of ***HugeApk***, my other site. 

It's hard to maintain more than 200 apps' information alone, so I was wondering if have the best way to do it, and I found 11ty!

The static site generator is the perfect way to manage all this information, easy and fast. I read about Next.js, Gatsby, Huge, and others; but when I found 11ty all changed, it's easy and friendly to learn.

Well, now I will start HugeApk 2.0 which is the new version of my site, now with a static site generator will be easier to do everything!

I learn about the Tag system, Pagination system, and others, my "job" here finishes so the next posts will be related to my new site and progress. See you!
