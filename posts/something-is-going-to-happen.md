I was frustrated with myself these days, but I don't stop reading and watching videos, trying to learn...

Dew days ago I read something about `Tag Pagination` on **StackOverflow** and I realize that is possible to make, since that, I just don't figure out how to do this. This is sad, but not at all Like I don't know how to do this but there's a way to do it, I know I will get it just don't know when. 

Yesterday on the community from **11Ty** on Discord a guy called @***Frijolie*** made this happen. He did it! So I was hoping for help from him, if I get helped, my project will continue, and I hope for that.
