Now the Collection `Games/Store` stays easier to put games because of the new widget, ***Typed List***. Instead, put 1 per 1 image or links, I just choose the type of what I want, and then the CMS put it all together.

The Homepage Pagination was created and works well, but, I need to make it order by ***ID*** and not dates...

Now I need to keep reading, studying, and making this happen. Bye!
