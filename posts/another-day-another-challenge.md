Well, thanks to the 11Ty community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GBkBy9u), especially "Aankhen" for the help, and patience.

The tag system was done, but not 100%, I mean the "problem" now is the `/tags/.../` page, it shows a static page and I said static not because I'm using 11Ty here, It's because when I change a word, for example, the page doesn't change.

I've tried to change the CSS file, but nothing happens, I change the `.njk` file layout, and nothing again...

I'm trying to see what I did wrong if I did. Let's see how things happen. See you!

**EDIT - 23:46**

Guys, after 2 hours after I publish this post, I play a song on Youtube, ***The Weeknd Dawn FM***, and change one word in the `permalink` and the page just reloads with all working. The tag system now is done!

I don't know why but every time I play this album, my mind just makes things happen. Thank you The Weeknd!
