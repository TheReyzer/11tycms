Well, thanks for the 11Ty community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GBkBy9u), specially "Aankhen" for the help, and patience. 

The tag system was done, but not 100%, I mean the "problem" now is the `/tags/.../` page, it's shows a static page and I said static not because I'm using 11Ty here, It's because when I change a word for exemple, the page don't change.

I've tried change the CSS file, nothings happen, I change the `.njk` file layout, and nothing again...

I'm trying to see what I did wrong, if I did. Let's see how the things happen. See you!
