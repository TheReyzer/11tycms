Well, thanks for the 11Ty community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GBkBy9u), specially "Aankhen" for the help, and patience. 

The tag system was done, but not 100%, I mean the "problem" now is the `/tags/.../` page, it's shows a static page and I said static not because I'm using 11Ty here, It's because when I change a word for exemple, the page don't change.

I've tried change the CSS file, nothings happen, I change the `.njk` file layout, and nothing again...

I'm trying to see what I did wrong, if I did. Let's see how the things happen. See you!

**EDIT - 23:46**

Guys, after 2 hours after I publish this post, I play a song on Youtube, ***The Weeknd Dawn FM*** and change one word in the `permalink` and the page just reload with all working. The tag system now is done!

I don't know why but every time I play this album, my mind just make the things happen. Thank you The Weeknd!
