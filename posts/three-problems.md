Well, the last 2 weeks are going so far the craziest since I start to learn at 11ty. I was studying 11Ty to create my blog, but, I found some problems...

1. Pagination System.
2. Tag List System.
3. Search Post System.

Yeah, maybe this was simple to do, but for me... I don't will give up, but is hard to keep the level for days doing different things and getting the same errors.

I hope when my last post in this scratch project was celebrating the conclusion of these 3 problems.

```javascript
var love = true;

if(code == love){
  console.log("keep doing this!");
}
```

Bye :D
